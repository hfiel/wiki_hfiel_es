 **ARCHIVED REPO** old wiki on hfiel.es

This is an archived copy with all the MD files from the old wiki on wiki.hfiel.es.
The information is a mix of Spanish and English, and not a single line has been changed since the original publishing.

**This is absolutely outdated, I do not recommend using it at all.**

I am keeping it here only for historical storage.

I will not provide any guarantee (or help) at all: **USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK.**

A specific license was never defined for the original content, but I am archiving it here under CC-BY-SA-4.0

# What is this?
This wiki was based on Wikepage (https://sourceforge.net/projects/wikepage/), a PHP and databaseless wiki/blog project. But since the PHP part is now obsolete and absolutely useless (it wont even run in a modern PHP server), I am only archiving the content files in wikepages' own version of markdown (MD) format. Keep in mind that the original structure and links betwween the files do not work at all: I hace created a separate folder for the original 1st level `menu` (AKA the index), but all the content pages are just stored in a single `content` folder, so without a completely manual process (i.e. dive and painfully follow the breadcrumbs from an original 1st level file to each of the content file) it is impossible to know to which section a specific file belonged. If you ever need to reproduce the original wikepage (***why????***) you will need to merge the files from both `menu` and `content` folders and recreate the proper index from the `menu.txt` file. and... probably a few steps more, so good luck.

Please note: most content was created circa 2010's and it has not been updated. So you probably want to make a sanity check before using ***ANY*** information found here, specially any links or commands for Linux/OSX/Windows.

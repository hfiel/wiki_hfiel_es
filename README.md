 **ARCHIVED REPO** old wiki on hfiel.es

This is an archived copy with all the MD files from the old wiki on wiki.hfiel.es.
The information is a mix of Spanish and English, and not a single line has been changed since the original publishing.

**This is absolutely outdated, I do not recommend using it at all.**

I am keeping it here only for historical storage.

I will not provide any guarantee (or help) at all: **USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK.**

A specific license was never defined for the original content, but I am archiving it here under CC-BY-SA-4.0

# What is this?
This wiki was based on Wikepage (https://sourceforge.net/projects/wikepage/), a PHP and databaseless wiki/blog project. But since the PHP part is now obsolete and absolutely useless, I am only archiving the content files in wikepages' own version of markdown (MD) format. Please note that without the PHP Wikepage backend the structure and links betwween the files do not work at all.

Please note: most content was created circa 2010's and it has not been updated. So you probably want to make a sanity check before using ANY information found here, specially any commands for Linux/OSX/Windows.

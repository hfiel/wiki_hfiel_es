So you’ve been disconnected from your server which resulted in an idle user session. You know this because when you used the “w" command, you see something like the following:


 22:47:28 up 285 days, 21:09, 2 users, load average: 1.04, 1.17, 1.30
 USER TTY FROM LOGIN@ IDLE JCPU PCPU WHAT
 root pts/0 ipxxx-xxx-xxx-xxx 23:54 26:40 9.26s 0.86s -bash
 root pts/1 ipxxx-xxx-xxx-xxx 22:44 0.00s 0.00s 0.00s w

There are a few ways to kill idle sessions. Including editing you sshd_config. But here’s an easy after-the-fact method:

Run this command:


 pstree -p

the output will look something like this:


 ├─sshd(3102)─┬─sshd(3649)───bash(3656)
 │            └─sshd(16680)───bash(16687)───pstree(17073)

Now look for the parent PID of the session – PID from the line WITHOUT the “pstree” command.

To kill session, type:


 kill 3649

Replace 3649 with your idle ssh’s PID. Check afterwards with the “w” command.

Now to prevent this from happening in the future you can edit your server’s /etc/ssh/sshd_config and add these lines:


 ClientAliveInterval 600
 ClientAliveInterval 3
